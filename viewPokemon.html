    <h3>Some Pokemon (from Gen 5 because that's obejctively the best generation)</h3>
    <div class="pokemon">
        <h2>Scraggy</h2>

            Scraggy doesn't play any games. Don't let his cute composure and baggy skin distract you from the fact
            that he goes hard in the paint in battle. Not to mention how awesome his little red hairdo is.

        <h2>Darmanitan</h2>

        <p>
            Darmanitan is the embodiment of chad energy in a pokemon. Just look at how jacked he is. An opponent's health bar
            is one Fire Punch away from getting depleted.

        <h2>Chikorita (not Gen 5 but still cool)</h2>

        <p>
            This sick starter from Gen 2 gets too much hate. I get that Cyndaquil and Totodile are pretty sick looking, but
            sometimes cute factor is a thing. I'll admit, playing Heart Gold was kinda tough after picking Chikorita, but
            sometimes you just need a grass type move like Hyper Beam or something.
